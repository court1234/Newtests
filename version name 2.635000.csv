sep 29 2017,2.634,5, its been more than six months since i wrote my first review of the chase bank mobile app since then there have been many improvements to the mobile app i still stand by my original review below  and if i could give this app  stars i would there are a few differences between what i can do with the mobile app and the chase website when i use my laptop computer  but thats to be expected other than that chase has done wonders with this app i use it almost every day   the chase mobile app is way better than my former banking affiliations online site because chase deducts the funds from my account when it funds a bill pay transaction  the available balance is not overstated so  the only way to generate an nsf fee is to pay someone by paper check  and then forget to keep track of the payment until it hits the bank i must have saved  or more in the past  months alone chase is my best friend forever  
oct 05 2017,2.634,2, i have been using this app for years and never had an issue  whatever update they put in place recently makes the image recognition worthless  i have just spent  minutes trying to take a clear photo of the front of the check  each photo is very blurry and i have to retake  images of the checks used to be fine when i used the app  i finally got a clear image of the front after  minutes of frustration and when i tried to take a photo of the back  i got the same blurry mess  then the app crashed on me  logged me out  and i have to start over  i am very upset right now as i am vacationing in a state that does not have a chase bank available i would like to deposit my money and cant  my other banking mobile app from another bank has none of these issues  come on chase  you have so much money but cant make a decent app  october now and this app is still worthless  i can clearly see the front and back of my checks and yet it keeps telling me the images are not clear enough  this app just hangs as well  utter fail 
oct 02 2017,2.634,5, the banking app for chase is very easy to navigate all options are located in one convenient drop down menu and each sectionoption is clearly labeled and are descriptive enough to easily find what you are looking for  all done using a very small amount of wording short  sweet and to the point in addition to being easy to navigate  this application contains all of the information regarding your accounts and their contents at least for checking and savings they do from balances to statements and transaction history  everything you need to locate is right at your finger tips i do however wish this app included the link the online version has which allows you to view the banks routing number and your account number as well as fico credit score information like almost all other credit cardbanking apps do

sep 30 2017,2.634,5, i have the update that came out a few months ago  and i must say that it works without a hitch i also use it for everything but i also use my computer as there are certain things that cannot be done on the app thats simply for security reasons  it is true i live by this app and im using the iphone   i do deposit checks and use the quick pay rather often the one part i do not like is that chase has made it with quick pay that the money goes right into the account ideally this is not a bad thing  but if you make a mistake and send the money to someone unintended then there is not a cancel or for the recipients to cancel the money it just goes straight into their account thats not cool with me other than that the app rocks and works without a hitch 
oct 06 2017,2.634,2, i really do like that i can deposit checks using my iphone i also like that i can be notified and view recent purchases in realtime however  there is one thing that annoys the heck out of me  every so often  and for no apparent reason  i cannot use my touch id to open your app i have to manually input my password and then go in and turn the touch id back on i have noticed that i am not the only person who has had that same problem  so  chase  when the heck are you going to fix that   i read a good number of reviews here that contain quite a few great suggestions that would improve the chase app but  apparently chase has gotten so big they quit listening to their customers you know who im talking about  chasethe very people who helped make you so big   hey chase it would seem to me that you have enough money to hire the very best top tech minds to make your app more user friendly
